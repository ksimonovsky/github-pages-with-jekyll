description: 
  1. I work as a barista at Starbucks. I am responsible for knowing how to make all of the drinks, heat up food, ring up customers, and work the drive thru.
  2. I swam in the Junior Olympics in my freshman year. I swam for both my club and school team that year, so I would train everyday for 2-3 hours a day to make the time cuts. 
  3. One of my favorite hobbies is reading. My favorite series to read is Harry Potter, which I have read and watched countless times.
