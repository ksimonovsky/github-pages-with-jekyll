Here are 3 interesting facts about me:
1. I work at Starbucks as a barista. I am responsible for being able to make every drink on the menu, heat up food, ring up customers and work the drive thru. 
2. I swam in the Junior Olympics as a freshman. I spent my freshman year swimming for both my club and school team and doing intense training everyday for 2-3 hours a day to reach the time cuts for the Junior Olympics.
3. My favorite book series to read is Harry Potter. I have read the books and seen the movies enough times to recite most of it from memory. I enjoy reading 1 book and its corresponding movie in order to compare the similarities and differences they share.
